## Making REST App with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose.

Back-end is not so intuitive but fun.
The reason it is fun is because there are ways to visualize it.

The main focus, however, is not debugging tool when programming back-end app.
Here, I am showing you how to do CRUD with Express for my math repository. Just note it is not complete yet. The front end is in another repository

### How to Use This App

First of all, install dependencies (`npm install`), then enter command `npm start`

Please use postman/curl/insomnia for CRUD operations.

Make sure your mongodb is working.

#### Background

I am building math repository app where everyone can easily access math theorems/axioms in different undergraduate/graduate textbooks.
Once the app is complete, people will be able to see the proofs for each axiom and references for each propositions/statements that back up the proof.
This is a baby step and here I am just making back-end app to make add/delete/update statements in a math book that is proof focused.
